I've been meaning to write a new post on this blog for quite some time now, but keep pushing it forward. After nearly 2 years since my last post (and even longer since an update), it's time for an update about what's been happening with me.

When I last posted, I was a little over half an year into working remote. I was working on [Gluster](https://www.gluster.org) and was leading the efforts on [GlusterD2](https://github.com/gluster/glusterd2). After working for about a year on getting Gluster and GlusterD2 ready to run in [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), the decision was made (not by me), to not work on this further. Instead of Gluster, the product would switch over to using [Rook ](https://rook.io)and [Ceph](https://www.ceph.com). I switched over to working on this effort full-time, sometime early 2019.

Early 2019 was also the time the construction of my new home was completed and when I moved into my own place. I had not expected to be an owner of my own home quite so early, but things just fell in place.

From my new home, I continued working on the new Red Hat Openshift Container Storage 4 product, now based on Rook and Ceph. I helped write a new Kubernetes operator, called [ocs-operator](https://github.com/openshift/ocs-operator) and helped set-up the CI for it. During this period, Red Hat was also purchased by IBM.

After working on ocs-operator for about 9 months, ocs-operator and Red Hat Openshift Container Storage 4 got ready for release. But I wasn't there to actually see it happen.

Because, at the end of 2019, I made the most difficult decision I've made till now. I was offered a new and interesting job, and I accepted it. I had started my professional career at Gluster/Red Hat, and after a wonderful 8.5 years, I bid farewell to my many wonderful friends and colleagues at Red Hat on 31st December 2019.

After a small break, I started the new year and the new decade by joining [Domino Data Lab](https://www.dominodatalab.com) as a Platform Engineer. Here, I'll be working on getting their impressive data science platform running well on Kubernetes. This is my first time working in a all new environment, with a bunch of new folks. I'm looking forward to learning and growing myself, and making new friends.

Quite a lot has happened to me in the past two years, which I didn't expect would happen. I'm looking forward to see what the next years bring. Hopefully, I'll be more regular with posts.

Till the next time, good bye!
