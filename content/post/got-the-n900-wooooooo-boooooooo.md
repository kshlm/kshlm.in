The 2nd week of my internship at Nokia Research Center is almost done. Nokia gave me my N900 device for me to develop with. I was so excited and was making plans on how to use it when the bomb was dropped. I’m supposed to use the device only inside Nokia premises, not supposed to take it out. :(

Bummer.

Anyways, got my internet connection in bangalore today too. Got
an Airtel connection. Airtel hasn’t any of the good plans in bangalore, so had to settle for one with just a 3gb limit for Rs.599pm. I’ve gotta manage with this for 3 months. But shouldn’t be a problem as, I’ll be spending most of the day in Nokia.

Going back to Mysore tomorrow. Hope to do something fun while there for the weekend.

Ciao.
