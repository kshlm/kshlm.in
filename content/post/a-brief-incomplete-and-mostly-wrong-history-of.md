> 1801 - Joseph Marie Jacquard uses punch cards to instruct a loom to
> weave "hello, world" into a tapestry. Redditers of the time are not
> impressed due to the lack of tail call recursion, concurrency, or
> proper capitalization.
>
> 1842 - Ada Lovelace writes the first program. She is hampered in her
> efforts by the minor inconvenience that she doesn't have any actual
> computers to run her code. Enterprise architects will later relearn
> her techniques in order to program in UML...
