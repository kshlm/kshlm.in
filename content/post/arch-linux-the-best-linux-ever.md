![Arch Linux , The best distro ever](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ac/Archlinux-official-fullcolour.svg/600px-Archlinux-official-fullcolour.svg.png)

Spent the whole day installing and customising Arch Linux on my desktop.

All I gotta say, its **FUCKIN’ AWESOME**!!

Arch (pronounced arch as in archery) is a lightweight, modular distro, aimed at slightly experienced Linux users. It allows you to customize the whole OS how you want.

You start with a base install which provides the core requirements to run a OS and install what you require on top of that.

I got the 64-bit install image (around 350MB) and installed it. After the install got just a barebones bash environment. From this point, what I wanted was what I got. I added the “kdemod” repositories and installed KDE 4.4.4. Installed the required drivers and I was set. Arch with kdemod is by far the smoothest KDE4 install I’ve ever done. It just runs. No hiccups anywhere.

The package manager, *pacman*, is the best package management tool I’ve used yet. Small, fast and gets the job done. One more thing I like about Arch, AUR or the Arch User Repositories. The AUR allows you to make and install any package not already present in the repositories. Using the AUR I got lots of additional packages installed, from source!! AUR makes
it easy for anyone to build a package from source. It’s like magic. I’ve not seen anything so easy till now.

I’m still doin the customizations. So catch ya all later.
