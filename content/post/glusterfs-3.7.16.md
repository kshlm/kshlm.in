# GlusterFS 3.7.16 released (very very late)

GlusterFS 3.7.16 has been finally released, over 2 weeks late. The late release was due to a combination of the Gluster summit and me falling sick.
This is a regular scheduled release for GlusterFS-3.7 and includes 20 bug fixes since 3.7.15.
The release-notes can be read [here][1].

The tarball can be downloaded from [download.gluster.org][2].

The CentOS [Storage SIG][3] packages have been built and are available in the centos-gluster37-test repository.
These should be available in the release repository soon.

Packages for other distros should become available soon.
See the READMEs in the respective subdirs at [download.gluster.org][2] for more details on how to obtain them.
