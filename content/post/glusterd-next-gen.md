I just presented a talk on GlusterD Next Gen / GlusterD-2.0 at the first ever Gluster Summit at Barcelona. I'm embedding the slide deck here for all to see. Fullscreen it to see it properly ~~(you also need to use Chrome/Chromium to get the slide renedered correctly, some issue with CSS that I'm too lazy to fix)~~.
